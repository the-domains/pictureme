I am a freelance photography hobbyist based out of Oahu, Hawaii. I have traveled around the world thanks to the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. I initially started taking photographs as part of a mission requirement while deployed to Tikrit, Iraq in 2003\. Upon my return from Iraq I purchased my first Digital SLR (DSLR) and continued taking photos as a way to relax. Something about capturing a moment the way I see it and, sharing that vision with the world seems right. I left active duty in 2009 but I continue to serve in the Army Reserves. My full-time career is in Information Technology.
